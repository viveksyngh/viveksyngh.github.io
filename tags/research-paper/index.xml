      <description>In this blog post, we are going to look into Amazon Dynamo paper which describes a set of techniques that can be combined to form a highly-available, distributed key-value data store. This paper then became foundation for databases such as Cassandra, Riak etc.&#xA;Dynamo addresses the need for an incrementally scalable, highly-available key-value storage system. The technology is designed to give its users the ability to trade-off cost, consistency, durability and performance, while maintaining high-availability.</description>

      <title>Merkle Tree and Itâ€™s Applications</title>

      <description>A Merkle tree, also known as hash tree is a hash based data structure. It is a tree data structure in which each node leaf nodes are cryptographic hash of data blocks for example a file or set of files, and each non-leaf node is cryptographic hash on its children nodes. A hash tree allows efficient and secure verification of the contents of a large data structure.&#xA;Merkle trees are used in distributed systems for efficient data verification.</description>

      <title>MapReduce Overview</title>

      <description>In this blog, I will be discussing MapReduce programming model and how it works. This blog is based on the original MapReduce research paper MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters from Google.&#xA;MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. User specifies a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set for intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.</description>
