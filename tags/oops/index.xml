      <description>Go has picked some good concepts from different kind of programming languages like procedural, functional and object-oriented programming language and combined them together to create a unique flavor programming language.&#xA;Go isnâ€™t an object-oriented language like C++, Java, C# etc. but it supports some of the OOPs concepts like Encapsulation, Type Methods, Composition etc.&#xA;In this blog post, we will see how can we implement those concepts in Go&#xA;Type Methods Link to heading Go does not have classes but it has types.</description>

      <description>In Go, everything is passed by value. When we pass arguments to a function, a function always gets the copy of the data passed. For example, passing an int value to function makes a copy of the int, passing a pointer value makes a copy of the pointer but not the data it points to.&#xA;When we pass a value to function it is called pass by value and when we pass a pointer to a function it is called pass by reference.</description>
