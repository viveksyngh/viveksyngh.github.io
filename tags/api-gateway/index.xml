      <description>In microservices architecture, there are several services running each designed for a very specific component of the system. When clients (Mobile Apps, Web Apps or Third party applications) communicates directly with these microservices then many problems arise.&#xA;The granularity of APIs provided by microservices is often different than what the client needs. Microservice APIâ€™s are very generic and granular in nature where each returns only a portion of data for functionality.</description>
