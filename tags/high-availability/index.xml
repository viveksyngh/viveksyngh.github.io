      <description>CAP theorem also known as Brewerâ€™s theorem was introduced by computer scientist Eric Brewer at Symposium on Principles of Distributed computing in 2000. In CAP theorem, C stands for Consistency, A stands for Availability and P stands for Partition tolerance.
Consistency: Every read receives the most recent writes or an error. For consistency, any read operation that begins after a write operation completes must return that value, or the result of a later write operation.</description>
