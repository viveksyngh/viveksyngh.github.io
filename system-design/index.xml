      <description>In this blog, I will be discussing MapReduce programming model and how it works. This blog is based on the original MapReduce research paper MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters from Google.
MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. User specifies a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set for intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.</description>

      <description>Word proxy defines, someone or something acting on behalf of something else. In computer science proxy means one server acting on behalf of other servers. A proxy server is a server ( or computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.
A client connects to the proxy server, requesting for some service (file, connection, web page) available from a different server and the proxy server evaluates the request as a way simplify and control itâ€™s complexity.</description>
